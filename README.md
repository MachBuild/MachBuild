See https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aid_ZSOzq_mmdHhPNGtaS2NWMTN1TGdHUWIyMzJ0Qmc&usp=sharing for updated native API availability.

We are looking for help creating the .net in cross platform c++.
See the Google Docs sheet and if you start working on one of the namespaces thats great! However we will only accept highly optimized code that will compile for the main operating systems.
