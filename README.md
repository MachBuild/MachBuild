MachBuild
=========

Revolutionize Code.


MachBuild is a new build tool that will do the following:

-Take as input: C#, VB.Net, Java, C++

-Give as output: C#, VB.Net, Java, C++ either as Source or Compiled

We are currently looking for as much help as we can get to work on the project, Anyone who has knowledge of C#, VB.Net, Java, Or C++ is welcome!

Also, if you have ever made a class or header (C++) for any of the languages that made programming easier, please add it to the contribution.

How will it work?
Machbuild will take in the source code from your program and parse it.
For example if in C# it runs into a method that is not available in the target language then we would "inject" a "helper" class into the output that makes up for the missing parts and would be written as optimized as possible you would not notice the difference.

Machbuild will be written in C# but that does not mean you cannot contribute if you do not know C#. We need people to write conversion classes in all of the languages written above.
